PolicyCenter supports out-of-sequence policy transactions. A policy transaction is out-of-sequence if its effective date is earlier 
than the effective date of another policy transaction that is already bound on the policy for that contractual period. PolicyCenter 
warns you that the policy transaction is out-of-sequence and prompts you to address any conflicts that occur as a result.

Trans Eff Date = Policy Effective date

 if we can try with different name for "Personal Vehicle Additional Interest" then its working fine. 
 i think, there is an issue when we are keeping same name("Personal Vehicle Additional Interest") with diffwerent vehicles

This can happen at multiple points in the Guidewire application. It has been seen in both configuration and integration code. 

All objects in PolicyCenter can either be in slice or window mode.

Slice - Contains the version of the object at a specific point in time, such as the effective date of the job. This is the mode that most people interact with.

Window - Contains the data for all the versions of the object for the life of the policy term.

There are many functions in the system that assumes we are running in slice mode. 
Each of these functions will throw the Illegal Argument Exception. To fix this, we need to find the PolicyPeriod. 
This may be in the current method or we may need to look in calling functions or traverse the entity model. We can then use the

getSlice(thePropertyYouNeedToMap)

method to get the slice that is effective on that particular field.

6854 - Mercer Employee ID Did Not Pass to Billing Center When Re-Added to Policy Center

Description of Issue: Mercer employee ID did not pass to Billing Center when re-added to Policy Center after being removed on the Policy Center side. 
Removal of employee ID passed without issue. This was tested with GE and Youdecide accounts as well, both of which passed the removal and re-adding of the employee ID without issue.
 Two seperate Mercer billing center accounts were tested, both did not pass re-added employee ID. Supports attached for all tests.
 
Expected Result: A payroll deduct employee ID number added in Policy Center will pass to Billing Center and display on the account summary screen field.
Actual Result: Mercer employee ID when removed passed from Policy Center to Billing Center. but when re-added did not pass from Policy Center to Billing Center.

GE Employee is appearing as active on the GE Eligibility File, however, the customer is being removed from PD through the automated roll off process in GW.

1. What is the issue? (NOTE: If applicable, please add supporting screenshots or documentation)

- GE Employee SSO 212726676 is appearing as active on the GE Eligibility File, however, the customer is being removed from PD through the automated roll off process in GW. 
This has happened multiple times since August and the customer has escalated to GE.
Customers appearing as active on the Eligibility file should not be removed from payroll deduct.

The PD Estimator shows this customer on Active Payroll. The QV dashboard Eligibility exception monitor has the reason for terminated.
 Both Billing Center and Policy Center show the status as Active. GE has confirmed the employee is active.
The customer wants to continue to pay their premium through payroll deductions.

based on that do we know how the message was sent from BC to PC to update the account and/or contact?
How the payload was composed? How the batch process would modify the account?
DH data would help. Do you know how the xxCenters communicate? There are MQs that update between BC and PC
You can look in the message transport in BC, find PAS, and deduce how the data is transformed and sent based on the event. You can see how the data is changed from the PD batch.

Well you can certainly follow how that data is transformed/sent but ultimately the PC MQ and data is the root of the defect right?


I don't know about the expected behavior - there are requirements for the batch process in Box.

https://app.box.com/folder/23321352235 
You can ask the client to reference requirements if necessary or look for yourself

I have attached analysis document on the PD issue.

GEINC12127857

999161873 - 

I reviewed the analysis and we need a meeting to discuss.  

Auto - Current and renewal term both show Karen as the PNI, the expired term has Brian as PNI

Home - Current term is Karen,  Renewal term is Brian and expired term is Brian

The billing rep believes that the if the PNI is changed on all terms - current, expired and renewal terms the employee will not be removed in the automated process.  

Will need to discuss with business requirement for synching the SSO to prior term.  

Please advise if it we should go ahead and manually change the expired term PNI's? 



schedule the call today on GE with stephen

kim asked about the some manual workaround with manual changes the expired term PNI's

local policy pc -- A100000045, 

1. D20220902KC01 - Earned premium due notices are displaying tax charge details as negative when partially or fully paid
 
 1. What is the issue?  Earned premium due notices are displaying tax charge details as negative when partially or fully paid. This also can affect the premium detail line, 
 which will display the total min due rather than the total premium portion of the min due.

NJ Home policy cancelled with earned premium due, including a tax charge that rolled up with a portion of its balance still due. On the final premium due notice,
 the detail table displays a negative value equal to the amount paid toward the charge, not the remaining balance of the charge. In addition, 
 the premium detail line displays the total min due rather than the portion of the min due attributed to premium

For example, E10224856 / H100007428 issued a final premium due notice on 6/12/22. The tax due was $0.12 but displayed as -$1.26 in the detail table. 
Premium detail is correct for this example.

Expected Action:  

Final Premium Due notices will display the remaining amount due for the given charge, and if nothing is due then $0.00 is displayed.

Actual Action:  

Final Premium Due notices are displaying the amount paid towards the tax charge and not the remaining amount due. Premium details on these invoices are also incorrect, 
displaying total min due rather than the portion attributed to premium.

2. When did the issue occur? (i.e., date/time, frequency)

Recent PROD examples from June 2022

E10310142 / H100012446 (6/25/22 EP notice)

E10224856 / H100007428 (6/12/22 EP notice)

3. Where is this issue taking place? (i.e., Contact Manager, Policy Center, Claims Center, Billing Center, Portals, Datahub)

Billing Center

4. What is the Severity of this issue? (i.e., Low, Medium, High, Critical)

High

5. Additional information: (i.e., Workaround, LeanKit Link, Impact & Volume, Submission / Account / Policy / Claim Number, etc.)

No workaround

Total volume of earned premium notices issued in the last year August 2021 to July 2022 for states with tax is 2113.

Fully earned states is 1288

2 . GEINC11058126 - Mercer Cancel Transactions
Updated: 

1.  The Cancel transaction amount term number is incorrect on the daily Activity file. The data pull is picking up multiple terms with a cancelation transaction.

Change: Cancel transaction amount on manual file output will pull from the correct term and populate with that term’s cancel transaction amount.

2. Cancel Code 1 is being sent on the daily filer as a positive balance: Mercer is requesting this be sent as negative value.

Change mercer splitter logic to force a negative value for Cancel Code 1 on the daily file

3. EIC is sending the term number at the end of the policy number. i.e. -1,-2.  On the renewal this creates a new policy number in their system.  Mercer requested we stop sending the the term in the policy field. 

Change: Turn off the special logic to add the term number to the policy number. Open question to mercer: Do they need the term number in a different location

Short Description: Cancel transaction amount and term number on the Mercer Daily Activity file is incorrect

Description: Cancel transaction amount and term number on the Mercer Daily Activity file is incorrect. The data pull is picking up multiple terms with a cancelation transaction.

The term number for the policy on the Mercer Daily Activity file is incorrect. The cancel transaction was associated with term 2 however term 1 is reflected on the activity file.


Example:

Auto policy term 2 cancelled on 1/24/22 for -$1685.53 in Billing Center. This transaction was on the 1/26/22 manual file sent to IT with a transaction amount of $0.00. The output file sent to Mercer has a transaction amount of -$3176.01, which is incorrect. Auto policy has two cancel transactions in Billing Center, -$1490.48 for Auto term 1 and -$1685.53 for Auto term 2. Total of both transactions is -$3176.01 which is what’s listed on the manual file. The expected transaction amount was -$1685.53.


Test Data (acct/submission/policy/claim #):

E10141199 / A100003761 (1/26/22 Mercer Manual File)


Expected Action:

Cancel transaction amount on manual file output will pull from the correct term and populate with that term’s cancel transaction amount.

Actual Action:

Cancel transactions are totaling all the policy term’s cancellations.




3.  Need a mechanism to re-inject failed payments from Paymentus to PC or BC --- Enhancement 
Executive Sponsor: Mike Mucher Business Owner(s): Cordima,Kimberly Systems Impacted: Guidewire BillingCenter What is this addressing?: Enhancement - New configuration or change

When do you need this?:

Is there a work around for this issue?: No

Full Description - When there is a payment failure sending a real-time Paymentus payment to PC or BC an email is sent to the Billing inbox
– Failed Payment Notification for PAS. A Billing rep needs to manually enter the payment into Billing Center. 
There needs to be a mechanism to re-inject the failed payments to PC or BC when this occurs.

Narrative/Description:  
UncollectibleWriteoffPayments and CollectionsWriteoffPayments Activities are not being created consistently when payment is made on policies that have collection or 
uncollectible write off.  
Policy A517914A1 had a collection’s write off in the amount of $575.84 on 5/17/22. Payment in the amount of $250 was received on 5/24/22 and
 an activity was not created to notify the billing rep to reverse the write off. 
 A disbursement was created for the overage and subsequently was rejected.  
 The write was reversed and the payment applied.  
An activity was not created to notify billing of the payment.  
Test Data (acct/submission/policy/claim #):  999161474 policy A517914A1
Expected Action:   UncollectibleWriteoffPayments and CollectionsWriteoffPayments Activities should be created if a payment is received on an account where 
there is a write off for uncollectible or collections. 
The  Activity “Payment on collections Writeoff” or “Payment on uncollectible Writeoff” should be sent to the Billing General Activity Queue to be reviewed, worked and closed. 
Actual Action:   No Activity was created.

              Payment Reversal Opened Delinquency with Incorrect Event target dates and all events completed on the same date.
Payment reversal on 1/14/21 opened delinquency as expected, however, the Event Target dates are out of order and all events completed on the same date.

The order of events should be Past Due Reminder, Late Fee, Send Cancel Request but the target dates are 1/18/21 – Send Cancel Request, 1/19/21 – Late Fee, 1/20/21 – Past Due Reminder. etc. In this example the target date for the Send cancel request was before the Past Due reminder notice – See attached screen shots. The trigger date appears to be missing the required number of days to execute each step. The events all completed on 1/20/21.

Test Data (acct/submission/policy/claim #):
999875971
999879342 (account has same issue)

Expected Action:
It is expected that a delinquency will complete Event dates in the standard order per delinquency requirements, even when opened due to payment return.

Actual Action:
Delinquency that opens after a payment return has incorrect Event target dates and all events completed the same day.

While not ideal, it is possible to create an adhoc “enrollment file”, have PROD Support push it to the PROD GW location, 
then run the batch (or if it has a unique name, it can even run overnight at the normal time, as it will be picked up along with the actual enrollment file for that night).
 
Anyway, we can discuss, but this is a potential method in which to fix accounts that are not correct in GW.




A PaymentInstrument is a financial instrument that can be or has been used to make a payment.
If the PaymentInstrument points at an Account or a Producer, the payment instrument can be used to request more payments.
For example, a credit card payment instrument that has enough information to be used to request more payments from the payment system can have an Account set on it. 
We also request money from the Responsive (PaymentMethod) payment instruments by asking the Payer to send the payment and waiting for them to send the money."
  
A PaymentInstrument may be associated with either an Account or a Producer for re-use, but not both."


Producer ID = 
The Producer which has this instrument as one of its available instruments for initiating payments.
A PaymentInstrument may only belong to one Account or Producer (or neither), so if this field is set,Account must be null."


Token = The identifier of the PaymentInstrument in the external payment system"

PaymentMethod = The method of payment used by this instrument (CreditCard,EFT,check,ACH,Cash,Responsive etc)
