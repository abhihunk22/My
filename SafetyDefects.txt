What could this individual do to have a greater impact?
Being positive helps reduce stress, increases productivity as well as interpersonal relations with others.

Take initiative to accomplish tasks
Building long-term relationships has been shown to be vital to career growth.
A forward-thinking employee is considered an asset.
What particular strengths does this individual display?
more emphasis on quality rather than quantity

strength 
I truly believe my strong work ethic is my biggest strength.
When I commit to a deadline, I do whatever needs to be done to meet it in a quality manner. 

My curiosity is one of my greatest strengths. When taking on a new project, 
I enjoy asking clients questions about their hobbies and backgrounds. 
This helps me establish a personal connection with them while keeping communication easy and productive.
 I know how important establishing quality relationships with customers is for a sales program and company as a whole, 
 and I feel I would fit into your climate well.”


May Defects : 
1.	Prod 332 STP Exception for TL resubmitted overnight and issued STP check

Issue Description: Total loss appraisal received, all activities triggered as expected, STP exception triggered for Total Loss, 
exception resubmitted overnight, should have remained but STP payment was issued as if the vehicle was repairable. 
Different from Prod 130 because the STP exception did hold the payment initially & different from Prod 310 because the vehicle IS deemed a total loss in CC.
Details:
3/9 Total loss appraisal received.
3/9 STP Exception (Settlement Type is Total Loss) triggered as expected
3/9 Exposure assigned to ASU adjuster as expected.
--STP Exception was not removed by adjuster--
3/10 STP Estimate resubmitted for payment- as expected overnight
3/10 STP payment issued- Not expected**

See attached document for screen shots of claim history as well as CCC's history.


when "Total loss appraisal received" in CC
      - all activities triggered 
	  - STP exception triggered for Total Loss
      - exception resubmitted overnight
	  - STP payment issued- Not expected**  ---- issue 

STP Estimate Stopped due to STP Exceptions (Settlement Type is Total Loss)- as expected

2.	Production Issue #130: TL appraisal received, Payment issued as if repairable

-----> Total loss estimate received,payment issued via STP as if vehicle was reparible. 

Claim Center Production Issue# 130: TL appraisal received, STP exception not triggered, indemnity payment issued to DTP A/B as if vehicle was repairable.

Details: LAMA003C88 – Total loss appraisal received, confirmed total loss flipped to ‘Yes’, New Total Loss activity generated to a total loss adjuster,
 however, payment issued to the DTP shop on file as if this was a repairable vehicle. 
 
 That check has been stop paid – but why did that happen along with (it seems) the other correct/expected TL actions.
Expected Result: STP exception activity, no payment, New Total Loss received activity and assignment to TL adjuster.

1.Prod64  --> STP exception "Vehicle incident description must not be empty" is not clearing once that field is completed by the adjuster and "Resubmit" is selected. Error occurs.
                Also occurs with errors: STP not eligible, claim description must not be empty
12/8 MM: Also occurs with other errors requiring correction within the claim. Examples: LAMA003E2E; LAMA0039AE; LAMA003E94; LAMA003F31
12/10 MS: Updated ticket with note and screen shots from LAMA00448A
12/20 MM: increase to high severity 
2/15 MS: EY asks SIC to review to see if this issue is still occurring and what the appropriate severity is so it can be prioritized accordingly.
2/16 MM: Email to trainers to see frequency of this issue. 1st response LAMA0083F9 shows user was able to fill field and submit properly. Awaiting additional responses - possible user error.
2/22 MM: User Sofia Ramirez rec'd error on claim: LAMA0085f3. Payment did issue - asked for more details about what user was doing when error received and how it resolved.
4/1 MM: Also occurred on LAMA00B1BA, will add to write up & update SNOW
4/14 MM: Occurred on LAMA00BD30 - sent video to EY

2. Prod101 --->Disappearing deductible applied in full to first payment (to insured). Subsequent payment (to lienholder) is generating an approval to review for disappearing deductible
                  example: LAMA0025F3
11/23 MM: Engaged EY as a workaround will be required
1/7 KT:  sent follow up to EY for more info.  Chris Rushton reports inability to close exposures when this occurs too, looking also to see if this is a separate issue 
             and the volume of claims affected
2/8 MM: Per Cate F., Marcus found workaround - enter a $0 payment under the Safety Shield Disappearing Deductible category & the subsequent check will issue without the approval
           activity. I asked for claim number to review potential system generated letters advising of a $0 pmt. Claim is: LAMA0059EA. Does not appear letter generated.
2/16 MM: EY advises there is no check with Disappearing Deductible to determine if an approval is needed. To change that would be a CR. Regarding the escalation & looping of the 
               aprpoval - this is ADL issue - Indicator needs to be marked as "yes" for all group supervisors. Multiple R2 groups do not have the supervisor indicator. 
			   KT will review submitted info.
4/15 MM: Email to KT to see if this issue needs to remain open now that Marcus has been given supervisor indicator. He recommends I check with Marcus. 
         I emailed Marcus to see if this is still an issue. Marcus has been using workaround to avoid this issue. He will avoid workaround on 1 claim to see if it processes correctly. 
           Unk when qualifiying claim will arise.
4/22 MM: Marcus advises the Activity is still creating (Per ntoes 2/16 - this would be a CR) but the looping has not persisted: Example: LAMA00B648. I reviewed requirements - 
              there is no check on the Activity to see if the disappearing deductible has already been applied in the requirements. It appears that now the looping has resolved 
              this item is behaving expected. Advised Marcus of same. We may be able to close this item.
4/26 MM: Marcus thinks this should be considered for CR. I ask him to quantify impact.
4/27 MM: Marcus states impact is several checks per week. Email to KT for his thoughts regarding whether this qualifies as CR and if it should be pursued.
4/27 MM: KT agrees this is a defect. Payment approval submits if user does not apply ded based on soft warning. Soft warning should not appear if already applied and furthermore, 
               the user does not have the ability to enter the disappearing deductible because the button is no longer available. Keeping item open.

Hi All,

Today I didn’t get chance to work on my defect. Because I was working with the other engagement. 
I will resume investigation on defect #101 (16/06).

Note # Today I have faced a lot with system slowness & stuckness. 

Thanks,
Abhimanyu
