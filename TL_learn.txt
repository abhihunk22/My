Introduction - done 
Beginner's Journey - done 
Technical vs fundamentals - - done  (24th Sept)
    A) Filled and unfilled orders  - 
			           follow the footprint strategy will allow us to judge that where the unfilled orders are.we ll always try to judge that unfilled orders.
			           7 steps judgments tht we can buy/sell from this zone or not
				       same day ke zone se hi bahut impactful hai , intraday mein kuch setup they ll provide . jo same day kelevel se hi trade kerna hoga.
					   same day level means , suppose jo aaj zone bna,10mins chart , suppose drop base really bna , yeh se price upper jaa sakta hai per yeh perfact zone nai hai.
	B) Volume - volume indicatore, indicate that ek candle/timeFrame pe kitna volume trade hua hai buy/sell ka.			   
    C) SMA - Simple Moving Average- candle ka closing price,like 200sma,50sma(it will take 200 timeframe ka data leker simple moving avg. ka calculation provide karega),
	         moving avg y? (average move hota hai evrery next candle pe and old wale candle ll be removed, formed line of sma), exponential moving avg we always use, not SMA
    D) EMA 	- Exponential Moving Avg., most powerful indicators in trading , we always follow this EMA.daily time frame per ye always give btr result and spport also.we always use          
	          daily and weekly time frame for this in entire trading carrier. very strong support for EMA 20, use this.sidewise market mein yeh support nai leta hai.
			  koi bhi Ema indicators kam nai kerta hai sidewise mein .Generally ppl take trade like this, jab 50ema red wala line crossed 100ema blue line
			  (generally lower ema crossed higher ema from down to up then buy it) then its buy oppurtunity,
			  side wise market mein,but we r not use this concept. 			  we can see in chart.
			 ema crossed strategy in side way market, ll loss only.price action se identify market will be one sided or sideways
			 ema 20 use only...finally we use only EMA n Volume . ema only see in daily time frame
			 nifty/bnknifty -- kal nifty upper open hota hai aaj ke closing se,ya close upper deta hai , 
			 aaj ka jo bhi closing hai iske upper kal nifty close deta hai means  ema20 per support le reha hai
			 
			 banknifty - nifty ager aaj ke closing ke niche close hota hai and monday ko kal ke closing ke related mein upper close hota hai,
			 its means EMA20 per support le reha hai	
    E) RSI1_17Mins - Relative Strength Index(Over Bought and Over Sold{30 - 70},Momentum,Divergence), RSI indicator works only for sidewase market(Profit) not for trending market and 
	                 trending market mein kafi losses dega.RSI se momentum pta chalta hai only. SW hai ya trending yeh price action se pta chalta hai. 
	                 
    F) RSI2_9.37-  RSI Divergence ,,,, price go up but RSI  momentum showing down called Divergence.	
			
Price Action -A)Price Movement- N no. of trns happing in the form of buy and selling in evry neno seconds. 
              B)Price Action - done 
			  C)Retracement  - it means correction/retracement..price thory up jaa rahi then down , Pattern -done 
			  D)Dow's Theory_41mins - dow brought concept , to identify/judge where is trend is on either up side/down side/sw side.
			                   ager price HH(Higher High)HL(Higher Low) Series bnati hai toh it can uptrend. 
							   
							   Recent high is the higher of previous high called HH. recent low is the higher of the previous low called HL. ---> Up Trend(Stock/index)
					Swing's Condtion   		                 Movement 
					 Higher Highs & Higher Lows               UP 
					 Lower Highs & Lower Lows                 Down 
					 Neither HH HL Nor LH LL                 Sidwways 
					 
					 kabhi bhi stocks up se down direct nai jata hai,usko sideways jana hi hoga then trends moce either up/down.
					 idealy up/down trend identify hojata hai,confusion nai hoga ..always 4 pivots/swing(turnig points like new trend or reverse) chahiye identify kerne ke loye
					 always consider latest 4points 
					 HH LL --> SW , LH LL -->DW, LH LL ---> DW, 
					 LH HL --> SW, 
					 HH HL ---> UP(we use always, ager last pivot high hai aur current trend upper nikalta hai last high ka aur pivot abhi nai form hua hai then 
					               definatly hiherHigh banega , hum log ko yehaan imagine kerna hoga , q ki abhi yeh pivot nai form  hua hai toh yeh trend upward hai)
					 On Candle --> hum log ko wicks ko consider karenge  higher high or lower low identify kerne ke liye.
					 
					 koi bhi stock or index mein trend diffenernt ho sakte hai different time frame per. 
					 Like ek stock,15mins ke time frame mein upword,1day ke TF mein sideways or 1hour ke TF mein downword ho sakta hai.
                     later we ll discuss about trend on diffrnt TF.					 
					 Equal lows and LH --->  SW, 15mins and 1 hour is SW trend , daily is DW,wekly is SW ON AsianPaints..   
					 
					 Posibilities anything --> UP-SW-UP 
					                           DOWN -SW-Down       
                                               UP SW Down
                                               DOWN SW UP   --> its depends also on which time frame we are seen.hum log ko focus kerna hai ki 
											      kuon sa time frame per kuon sa trade condition dekhna hai, aur jo latest trade condition kiya hai
												  latest kuon se TF mein kiya trade condition kiya hai, 
												  tht is wt we have to check thruout the follow the footprint startegy.

			  E)Fibonacci Retracement_21.05Mins  --->  fibonachiiii....23.6%,38.2%,50% and 61.8% , there are major formulas that are getting used in fibonacci retracement.
			                                           38.2% - pepole are agressive but not tht much in buying even not wait for 50%,fir yehi se up trend continue.
													   50% -> 50% retracement is the best considering always, hum log price action mein used karenge.yeh 50% kerta hai 
                                                                toh yeh up trend ker sakta hai idealy.													   
														61.8% --> golden ratio is 61.8%,this is human psychology ratio,jab bhi yeh 61.8% aayega then very strong chance to 
														its go up trend as per human psychology.its very attractive price to buy as per human psychology.
							how its get calculated --> done all ....2nd divideby 3rd , 2nd divide by 4th,2nd divide by 5th...like that we r calculating this percantage.							
			  F)Support & Resistance - Theory_37.08 --> what all can act like support n Resisitance ?
			                                            Straight Line 
														Round Numbers
														Moving Averages (EMA)
														Trend Lines 
												More Testing of a level will make the level weaker.
												Reversal in roles 
												-  Resisitance after breaking becomes support and Support after breaking  becomes Resisitance
												-  Price Halts Near Support & Resisitance gives powerful movement. ..these all are cover in chart reading
