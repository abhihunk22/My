2. GEINC11140467 - Premium Missing on Cancel/Rewrite for Earlier Effective Date
                   Hi Team,
                   Insured, Megan Casey, E10332622/A100013382 called about billing as they have not received a bill. When I open the policy there is no premium listed.
				   Please check and advise.
                   Issue is specific to policies that were cancelled and rewritten for an earlier effective date with a policy change effective the same day
				   as the original effective date
Tom Flynn 8:48 PM   Account #E10449498  Policy #A100021655
@Sushmitha_Ravichandran - this occurred recently on policy change 0208179228, but we were able to get passed it by changing the date. We know the exact steps to recreate the issue.
1) Issue a policy.
2) Cancel the policy, and then rewrite full term to an earlier effective date.
3) Quote a policy change with an effective date equal to the effective date of the policy issued in step 1.

	-----------------------------------------------Rewrite---------------------------------------
rewrites are similar to renewals
A rewrite is associated with another policy period (the canceled policy period).However,the rewrite typically has a new policy number unrelated to the one used by the previous policy period. 
Insurers can also use rewrites to transfer a policy from one account to another. This is known as an account rewrite. In this situation, the original policy 
under the original account is cancelled. The rewrite creates a new policy based on the original policy but for a different account. For example, suppose there is an account 
for a household with two parents and a daughter. There are two personal auto policies - one for the parents and one for the daughter. The daughter is now an adult and 
wants to move the policy to her own account. To do this, the insurer cancels the daughter's original policy and rewrites the policy to a new account in her name.

Rewrites are usually categorized as one of the following types:

Full-term - The rewrite replaces the entire term of the original policy. Typically, the original policy is cancelled as a flat cancellation. 
            The effective date of the rewrite is usually the same as the effective date of the original policy.
Mid-term - The rewrite replaces a portion of the original term of the original policy. Typically, the original policy is cancelled as a mid-term cancellation. 
           The effective date of the rewrite is on or after the effective date of the cancellation. The rewrite may have an expiration date equal to the original policy's 
		   expiration date. Alternatively, the rewrite may last for an entire new term and have an expiration date later than the original policy's expiration date.

GEINC12969427- CIF is missing customer record and customer is unable to make payment
Description --> The CIF is missing the account and policy information for E10376260. The customer is not able to make payment through paymentus. 
                The customer was on the CIF on 7/15/22 and then dropped from the CIF 7/16/22. As of 2/21/23 the customer is still not on the CIF however 
				there are 3 active policies on the account and we would expect a CIF record.
